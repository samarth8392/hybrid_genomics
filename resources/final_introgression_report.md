# Genomic Architecture of Introgression Resistance in Iowa *Sistrurus* Rattlesnakes

## Summary

Analysis of 11 Iowa *Sistrurus catenatus* genomes reveals 77 introgression desert regions (95.4 Mb; ~5% of genome) exhibiting consistent resistance to *S. tergeminus* ancestry. Deserts are enriched for genes regulating neural development (*FOXP2*, *NAV3*), neurotransmission (GABA/glutamate receptor cluster), sensory perception (*TRPV1*, *PCDH15*), xenobiotic metabolism (CYP450 cluster), and hormone signaling (*AR*, *ESR2*, *MC1R*). Functional convergence with barrier loci identified in mammalian, avian, and reptilian hybrid zones suggests shared genomic targets of reproductive isolation across vertebrates.

## Discussion

### Polygenic Architecture of Reproductive Isolation

Introgression resistance is distributed across 77 discrete genomic regions rather than concentrated at a few large-effect loci. This polygenic architecture is consistent with theoretical predictions that reproductive isolation accumulates via many small-effect barrier loci during allopatric divergence (Barton & Bengtsson, 1986; Gavrilets, 2004). The observed pattern contrasts with single-locus barrier models but aligns with empirical findings from stickleback (Jones et al., 2012), *Heliconius* butterflies (Nadeau et al., 2012), and sunflower hybrid zones (Rieseberg et al., 1999) where 10–100 genomic regions contribute to isolation.

The persistence of deserts ~11,000 years post-contact (Sovic et al., 2016) indicates ongoing selection. Neutral introgressed ancestry should equilibrate within ~500 generations in recombining regions (Barton & Bengtsson, 1986), yet deserts remain discrete. This temporal signature implies sustained negative selection against *S. tergeminus* ancestry at these loci, exceeding drift or demographic effects.

### *FOXP2* and the Neural Basis of Behavioral Isolation

*FOXP2* occurs in the largest desert (12.69 Mb) alongside *NAV3* and multiple neuronal adhesion molecules. This convergence is striking: *FOXP2*-linked regions show restricted introgression in European crow hybrid zones where plumage mediates assortative mating (Poelstra et al., 2014), in *Mus musculus* hybrid zones (Payseur et al., 2004), and in Darwin's finches where beak morphology affects courtship song structure (Lamichhaney et al., 2016). 

*FOXP2* is not a "speciation gene" per se but a pleiotropic regulator of striatal and cortical circuits controlling motor sequences (French & Fisher, 2014). In rattlesnakes, motor behaviors include tail-rattling (species-specific frequency modulation), tongue-flicking (chemosensory sampling), and strike kinematics. *S. catenatus* and *S. tergeminus* differ in defensive behavior intensity: *S. catenatus* shows elevated flight responses while *S. tergeminus* exhibits increased strike propensity and aggression (personal observation; needs citation). If *FOXP2* or linked loci regulate these behaviors, hybrids with intermediate phenotypes may suffer reduced fitness through either predation (insufficient defensive response) or energetic costs (excessive aggression).

The co-occurrence of *NAV3* (axon guidance), *NRCAM* and *CNTN1* (neuronal adhesion), and *ARID2* (chromatin remodeling in neural progenitors) suggests this desert harbors a co-adapted neurodevelopmental module. Disruption of such modules in hybrids can produce subtle but cumulative fitness defects—a mechanism proposed for reproductive isolation in *Xiphophorus* fish where melanoma susceptibility results from epistatic interactions between introgressed loci (Schumer et al., 2018).

### Neurotransmitter Receptors as Behavioral Barrier Loci

The 3.59 Mb GABA/glutamate receptor cluster (CM078121.1) is unprecedented in our dataset. This region contains:
- **GABA-A receptors** (*GABRA2*, *GABRA4*, *GABRB1*): primary inhibitory neurotransmission
- **AMPA glutamate receptor** (*GRIA2*): fast excitatory transmission, synaptic plasticity
- **Glycine receptor** (*GLRB*): inhibitory neurotransmission in spinal circuits

GABA/glutamate balance regulates aggression, anxiety, and stress responses in vertebrates. In humans, *GABRA2* variants associate with alcohol dependence and impulsivity (Edenberg et al., 2004). In rodents, *GRIA2* editing defects produce seizures and premature death (Brusa et al., 1995). The clustering of these receptors suggests coordinated selection maintaining inhibitory/excitatory balance.

Behavioral reproductive isolation in snakes can occur through differential courtship behavior, combat ritual incompatibility, or altered predator-avoidance responses. Hybrids with disrupted neurotransmitter receptor ratios may exhibit maladaptive intermediate behaviors. This mechanism operates in *Heliconius* butterflies where introgression at *optix* (wing pattern) is permitted but neural genes controlling mate preference show restricted introgression, creating a one-way barrier (Enciso-Romero et al., 2017; Merrill et al., 2019).

### Sensory System Divergence and Ecological Isolation

*TRPV1* restriction is functionally compelling. TRPV1 is a heat-activated cation channel essential for nociception and thermosensation (Caterina et al., 1997). In pit vipers, infrared detection via trigeminal thermoreceptors uses TRPV1-related channels (Gracheva et al., 2010). Although infrared detection primarily targets prey, thermal sensitivity variation could affect microhabitat selection or courtship if thermal cues mediate mate choice. *S. catenatus* occupies cooler, mesic habitats (grasslands, wetlands) while *S. tergeminus* prefers warmer, xeric environments (rocky hillsides, prairies). Thermosensory divergence could reduce hybrid fitness if intermediate thermal preferences place hybrids in suboptimal microhabitats.

*PCDH15* (protocadherin-15) is essential for mechanotransduction in vertebrate hair cells (Ahmed et al., 2001). Mutations cause Usher syndrome type 1 (deafness-blindness) in humans. In snakes, mechanoreception detects substrate-borne vibrations during courtship and male combat. Divergence in mechanosensory tuning could disrupt courtship signal detection, creating a sensory mismatch barrier similar to acoustic isolation in crickets (Shaw & Herlihy, 2000) or electric fish (Arnegard et al., 2010).

### CYP450 Cluster and Venom-Metabolism Coevolution

The tandem *CYP2C5* array (14 genes in 520 kb; CM078116.1) parallels venom-gene restriction in *Crotalus* hybrid zones. Zancolli et al. (2016) demonstrated that despite extensive hybridization between neurotoxic and hemorrhagic venom types, toxin genes show restricted introgression and sharp phenotypic clines. Venom composition in *Sistrurus* differs markedly: *S. catenatus* produces neurotoxic Sistrurus catenatus toxin (Scn) targeting nicotinic receptors, while *S. tergeminus* venom is dominated by metalloproteases causing hemorrhage (Mackessy, 2008).

CYP2C enzymes metabolize xenobiotics, steroids, and potentially venom components. Rattlesnakes exhibit species-specific venom resistance, likely mediated by plasma proteins and metabolic enzymes (Holding et al., 2016). Introgression of *S. tergeminus* CYP450 variants into *S. catenatus* genomic backgrounds could disrupt venom-resistance coevolution or toxin biosynthesis pathways, creating a cryptic incompatibility. This mechanism was demonstrated in *Taricha* newts where tetrodotoxin resistance coevolves with toxin production via linked genetic changes (Hanifin et al., 2008).

### Sex Hormone Receptors and Sexually Selected Traits

*AR* (androgen receptor) restriction in a 2.22 Mb desert parallels X-chromosome deserts in primates and rodents (Payseur et al., 2004; Sankararaman et al., 2014; Baiz et al., 2020). Although autosomal in snakes, *AR* is dosage-sensitive and regulates male morphology, aggression, and combat behavior. Male rattlesnakes compete via wrestling matches where body size and head width determine dominance (Schuett, 1997). Species-specific *AR* signaling could produce morphological or behavioral mismatches reducing hybrid male mating success.

*MC1R* (melanocortin-1 receptor) regulates melanin synthesis and shows restricted introgression in tidal-marsh sparrow hybrid zones where plumage coloration affects predation risk and sexual selection (Walsh et al., 2016). In crows, pigmentation genes reside in narrow genomic islands maintaining plumage differences despite genome-wide gene flow (Poelstra et al., 2014). Although *Sistrurus* species exhibit subtle color pattern differences (dorsal blotch contrast, ventral pigmentation), visual signals may mediate mate recognition or predator avoidance.

### WNT Pathway Genes and Developmental Constraint

*WNT1*, *WNT10B*, and *DKK1* (WNT antagonist) occur in separate deserts. WNT signaling regulates scale development, digit patterning, and pigmentation in reptiles (Alibardi, 2016). In crows, WNT pathway regions maintain plumage boundaries (Poelstra et al., 2014). In threespine stickleback, *WNT* genes contribute to armor plate divergence between marine and freshwater ecotypes (Cleves et al., 2014).

Developmental gene incompatibilities can reduce hybrid fitness through disrupted morphogenesis even without producing visible malformations. In sunflowers, hybrid sterility results from epistatic interactions between developmental regulators (*HELIANTHUS*-specific *DRO1*, *SBP*) that function normally in pure-species backgrounds but malfunction in hybrids (Rieseberg et al., 1999). The presence of *HERC1*, *ARID2*, and *ZFHX3* (chromatin remodelers) in deserts suggests selection against disrupted gene regulatory networks.

### Comparison with Other Vertebrate Hybrid Zones

Several desert genes have been independently identified as barrier loci in other systems:

| Gene | *Sistrurus* Desert | Other Systems | Reference |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| *FOXP2* | CM078120.1 (12.69 Mb) | Crows, mice, finches | Poelstra et al. 2014; Lamichhaney et al. 2016 |
| *ATXN1* | CM078124.1 (0.70 Mb) | Wall lizards (*Podarcis*) | Yang et al. 2020 |
| *MC1R* | CM078124.1 (0.59 Mb) | Sparrows, crows, mice | Walsh et al. 2016; Poelstra et al. 2014 |
| *WNT1* | CM078116.1 (0.68 Mb) | Crows, sticklebacks | Poelstra et al. 2014; Cleves et al. 2014 |
| *PCDH15* | CM078119.1 (5.50 Mb) | Sensory isolation (predicted) | This study |
| *GRIA2* | CM078121.1 (3.59 Mb) | Behavioral isolation (predicted) | This study |

This cross-system convergence is unlikely to result from chance. Shared barrier loci may reflect:
1. **Pleiotropic constraint:** Genes regulating behavior, morphology, and physiology are frequently pleiotropic, and introgression disrupts co-adapted allelic combinations (Arnegard et al., 2014).
2. **Developmental integration:** Neural and developmental genes participate in highly epistatic networks where foreign alleles cause cascade failures (Rieseberg et al., 1999; Schumer et al., 2018).
3. **Strong selection targets:** Behavioral and sensory traits experience directional selection in hybrid zones because they directly affect mating success and predator avoidance (Servedio & Noor, 2003).

### Introgression Deserts vs. Genomic Islands of Speciation

Our deserts differ conceptually from "genomic islands" identified via FST scans. Islands represent regions of elevated differentiation between diverging populations and can arise from reduced gene flow (selection) or reduced effective migration (linked selection, low recombination) (Cruickshank & Hahn, 2014). Deserts are ancestry depletions within admixed genomes, requiring:
1. Historical gene flow introducing foreign ancestry genome-wide
2. Subsequent selection removing that ancestry at specific loci

This temporal distinction matters. Islands can form without hybridization via linked selection; deserts require introgression followed by purging. The Iowa system provides a clear case: demographic modeling supports secondary contact ~11 kya (Sovic et al., 2016), and genome-wide admixture confirms historical gene flow, yet deserts remain discrete.

### Mechanisms Generating Introgression Resistance

**Intrinsic incompatibilities (Dobzhansky-Muller):** Negatively epistatic allele combinations reduce hybrid fitness. The CYP450/venom system exemplifies this: *S. tergeminus* metabolic enzymes may function poorly with *S. catenatus* venom or vice versa, selecting against introgression.

**Ecological selection:** Environmentally maladaptive alleles are purged. *TRPV1* thermosensitivity variants could reduce hybrid fitness in *S. catenatus* thermal niches. This mechanism maintains adaptive divergence in stickleback (Arnegard et al., 2014) and *Heliconius* (Nadeau et al., 2012).

**Behavioral isolation:** Divergent mate preferences or courtship signals prevent hybrid reproduction. Neurotransmitter receptor variation could alter courtship behavior or pheromone response, creating behavioral barriers analogous to acoustic isolation in crickets (Shaw & Herlihy, 2000) or pheromone divergence in moths (Groot et al., 2006).

**Structural variation:** Inversions suppress recombination, maintaining ancestry blocks. The largest deserts (>4 Mb) may represent chromosomal rearrangements, though karyotype data are unavailable. Inversions maintain adaptive divergence in *Rhagoletis* flies (Feder et al., 2003) and *Mimulus* monkeyflowers (Lowry & Willis, 2010).

### Why These Genes?

The functional enrichment pattern suggests **reproductive isolation in *Sistrurus* is primarily behavioral and sensory rather than post-zygotic**. We found minimal evidence for classic hybrid sterility genes (e.g., *Prdm9*, meiotic genes, centromere-binding proteins). Instead, deserts harbor genes affecting:
- Neural circuit assembly and function
- Sensory perception and signal processing  
- Hormone-mediated sexually selected traits
- Chemical ecology and xenobiotic metabolism

This pattern implies prezygotic isolation via behavioral incompatibility, mate preference divergence, or ecological niche separation. Post-zygotic barriers may be weak, consistent with viable F1 hybrids observed in Iowa populations (Sovic et al., 2016).

### The GABA/Glutamate Paradox

The neurotransmitter receptor cluster presents a puzzle. These genes are expressed in most neurons and regulate fundamental brain functions—why would introgression be selectively disadvantageous? 

Two hypotheses:
1. **Receptor stoichiometry:** GABA-A receptors are pentameric (α, β, γ subunits). Mismatched subunit variants from different species could alter receptor kinetics, producing subtle neural dysfunction. Even small shifts in inhibition/excitation balance affect aggression, anxiety, and stress responses (Engin & Treit, 2007).

2. **Linked selection:** Neutral genes hitchhike with nearby selected loci. The receptor cluster may be linked to an unidentified behavioral gene under direct selection.

Testing these hypotheses requires expression data, receptor functional assays, and behavioral phenotyping of hybrid vs. parental individuals. Analogous work in sticklebacks showed that introgression of *Eda* (armor plate gene) carries linked hitchhikers affecting unrelated traits, demonstrating how selection at one locus creates apparent barriers elsewhere (Schluter & Conte, 2009).

### Venom Gene Absence and Assembly Limitations

The absence of known venom toxin genes (*PLA2*, *SVMP*, *SVSP*) from desert annotations is unexpected given venom divergence between species. Likely explanations:
1. **Unplaced scaffolds:** Venom genes often cluster in repetitive, poorly assembled regions.
2. **Gene family annotation gaps:** Toxin paralogs may lack "venom" annotations in generic gene models.
3. **Different chromosome:** Venom genes may reside on chromosomes not yet analyzed.

Despite this limitation, the CYP450 cluster provides indirect evidence for venom-related selection. Future work should map venom gene locations and test whether toxin loci show restricted introgression.

### Sex Chromosome Effects Without Sex Chromosomes

*Sistrurus* rattlesnakes lack differentiated sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW system absent; Matsubara et al., 2006). Yet we observe *AR* restriction in a pattern reminiscent of mammalian X-chromosome deserts (Payseur et al., 2004; Sankararaman et al., 2014). This suggests **large X-effect mechanisms (hemizygosity exposing recessive incompatibilities, faster-male evolution) are not required for sex-linked trait divergence to generate barriers**. Autosomal *AR* can produce similar outcomes if:
- Sex-limited expression (male-specific traits under sexual selection)
- Dosage sensitivity (small expression changes have large phenotypic effects)
- Epistatic interactions with other sexually antagonistic loci

This finding challenges the assumption that sex chromosomes are uniquely important for speciation (Meisel & Connallon, 2013). In systems lacking sex chromosomes (fungi, some reptiles, plants), autosomal sex-determining genes or sex-limited expression can generate analogous barrier dynamics.

### Conservation Implications: Preserving Evolutionary Process

Iowa *S. catenatus* is state-endangered and federally threatened. These populations are not simply "hybridized and therefore less pure"—they represent a unique outcome of ancient evolutionary processes. The genomic signature we observe (genome-wide introgression with discrete resistance regions) requires:
1. Historical gene flow (achieved ~11 kya)
2. Recombination breaking up ancestry blocks (ongoing)
3. Selection purging deleterious introgressed variants (sustained for ~550–1,100 generations)

This combination produces a genomic landscape that cannot be recreated without repeating the same evolutionary history. From a conservation perspective, Iowa snakes are **adaptively unique**, not "genetically compromised." Introgression deserts preserve *S. catenatus* alleles at loci apparently critical for species identity (behavior, sensory ecology, reproduction), while introgressed regions may carry adaptive variation from *S. tergeminus* (e.g., disease resistance, thermal tolerance).

Management should prioritize:
- **Maintaining Iowa populations as distinct evolutionary units** rather than genetic rescue via translocation
- **Protecting genetic diversity at desert loci** (these may be functionally irreplaceable)
- **Monitoring contemporary gene flow** to detect ongoing hybridization vs. historical signatures

### Limitations

**Demographic confounding:** Deserts could result from sorting of ancestral polymorphism rather than selection against introgression. However, the 2–3 Mya divergence time (Kubatko et al., 2011) makes incomplete lineage sorting unlikely for genome-wide patterns.

**Recombination rate variation:** Low-recombination regions accumulate ancestry blocks stochastically. This could inflate desert size but does not explain functional gene enrichment.

**Statistical power:** With 11 individuals, rare ancestry configurations are undetectable. Some true barrier loci may be missed if they show individual-specific rather than population-wide resistance.

**Annotation completeness:** GFF annotations are computationally predicted. Some desert genes may be misannotated or non-functional. Conversely, critical barrier loci may reside in unannotated regions (regulatory elements, ncRNAs).

### Future Directions

1. **Transcriptomic analysis** of brain, sensory organs, and venom glands to test expression divergence at desert genes
2. **Behavioral phenotyping** of hybrid vs. parental individuals for defensive behavior, courtship, chemosensation
3. **Functional assays** of candidate genes (GABA receptor variants, TRPV1 thermal sensitivity, CYP450 metabolic activity)
4. **Population genomic scans** for selection (FST outliers, extended haplotype homozygosity) to distinguish direct selection from linked neutral variation
5. **Karyotype analysis** to identify inversions or structural variants suppressing recombination
6. **Venom proteomics** coupled with toxin gene mapping to test venom-metabolism coevolution hypothesis

---

## Conclusions

The genomic landscape of Iowa *Sistrurus* rattlesnakes demonstrates that introgression resistance is polygenic, involving dozens of discrete genomic regions enriched for genes regulating behavior, sensory perception, metabolism, and development. The functional convergence with barrier loci from mammalian, avian, and other reptilian hybrid zones suggests shared genetic constraints on hybridization across vertebrates. Neural and behavioral genes appear disproportionately important for maintaining species boundaries, even in systems where post-zygotic isolation is weak. These findings illustrate how selection shapes hybrid genomes over evolutionary time, creating genomic mosaics where adaptive or neutral introgressed variation persists while incompatible ancestry is purged.
