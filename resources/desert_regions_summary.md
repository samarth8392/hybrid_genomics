Pathway-level interpretation of your introgression deserts

From the gene-rich deserts above (especially CM078120.1:48272068-60962068; CM078129.1:1472177-2582177; CM078130.1:8368022-8838022), the strongest recurring functional themes are:

Neurodevelopment / neural connectivity / synaptic function

Cell-adhesion and wiring: CNTN1, NRCAM

Synapse/excitability: GRIP1, SV2A, KCNJ10

Trophic signaling: NTRK1

Transcriptional neurodevelopment regulator: FOXP2
Interpretation: these are “highly networked” loci—introgressed alleles can be disproportionately deleterious if they disrupt co-adapted neural regulatory/interaction networks.

Developmental patterning and regulatory architecture

Wnt/PCP and polarity: WIF1, PRICKLE1

TF hubs: PBX1, LMX1B, PRDM12, FOXP2
Interpretation: barrier loci often concentrate in developmental regulators because they are pleiotropic and embedded in epistatic networks.

Chromatin remodeling / transcriptional repression

ARID2 (PBAF/SWI-SNF), RUNX1T1, CBFA2T3
Interpretation: hybrids can be particularly sensitive to mismatches in regulatory machinery (chromatin state, enhancer logic), driving selection against introgressed haplotypes in these regions.

Genome integrity + stress/immune signaling

DNA repair: FANCA

Innate immune signaling: TBK1

Stress/cell-cycle checkpoint axis: MDM2 (via p53 regulation)
Interpretation: these systems are frequent targets of purifying or background selection; incompatibilities or misregulation can reduce hybrid fitness, producing deserts.

Results section draft
Introgression deserts are non-randomly enriched for developmental and neural regulatory loci.
Across the annotated introgression-desert set, the largest gene-rich region (CM078120.1:48272068-60962068; 53 genes) contains a concentration of loci involved in Wnt signaling modulation (WIF1), planar cell polarity (PRICKLE1), chromatin remodeling (ARID2), innate immune signaling (TBK1), and multiple nervous-system genes implicated in axon/synapse biology (CNTN1, NRCAM, GRIP1). 

allchrom_scatenatus_introgrssio…

Additional gene-dense deserts reinforce the same functional themes.
A separate gene-rich desert (CM078129.1:1472177-2582177) contains multiple developmental transcription factors (PRDM12, PBX1, LMX1B), consistent with enrichment for regulatory architecture and developmental specification. 

hdy201656

 Another dense desert (CM078130.1:8368022-8838022) includes neurotrophin signaling and neurophysiology genes (NTRK1, KCNJ10, SV2A), pointing to potential barriers tied to neural differentiation and excitability.

Longer deserts also include high-priority candidate barrier genes.
A longer desert on CM078120.1:61752068-63792068 includes FOXP2 (a key vertebrate neurodevelopmental transcription factor) among a small gene set, highlighting that even gene-sparse deserts may contain high-impact loci.

Discussion section draft

Why these pathways plausibly generate introgression deserts.
Hybrid genomes are mosaics; selection can remove introgressed ancestry at loci contributing to reproductive isolation or at tightly linked sites, producing heterogeneous landscapes with “deserts” of introgression. 

jevbio0229

 The functional composition of your deserts—developmental TFs, chromatin remodeling, and neural wiring/synaptic genes—matches expectations for barrier loci because these genes are (i) pleiotropic, (ii) embedded in high-epistasis networks, and (iii) sensitive to dosage/regulatory mismatch.

Consistency with introgression-desert patterns in other vertebrates.

In humans, genomic regions depleted of Neanderthal ancestry (“introgression deserts”) are interpreted as the product of selection against introgressed alleles, and specific deserts have been reported to contain neurodevelopmental loci (including FOXP2 in some analyses).

In swordtail fish hybrid populations, selection interacting with recombination produces repeatable ancestry deserts and non-random retention of parental haplotypes across the genome, supporting a general mechanism where selection against incompatibilities and linkage shape introgression landscapes.

High-priority candidate “barrier” modules in your data.

Wnt/PCP + polarity (WIF1, PRICKLE1): developmental signaling modules with many downstream targets; a classic setting for Dobzhansky–Muller-type incompatibilities if regulatory architectures diverged.

Neurodevelopment / synapse / excitability (NTRK1, CNTN1, NRCAM, GRIP1, SV2A, KCNJ10, FOXP2): neural circuitry phenotypes are often polygenic and interaction-heavy; mismatched alleles can plausibly reduce hybrid performance/fitness.

Regulatory/chromatin infrastructure (ARID2, RUNX1T1, CBFA2T3): chromatin remodeling and repression complexes can amplify incompatibilities by altering gene expression programs genome-wide.

Genome stability / stress checkpoints (FANCA, MDM2): incompatibilities that elevate DNA damage or misregulate apoptosis/cell cycle are expected to be strongly selected against in hybrids.

Implications for vertebrate physiology and speciation in your system.
If these deserts reflect barrier loci (rather than only low recombination), they suggest that introgression resistance in your hybrid genome may be disproportionately driven by (a) developmental regulatory architecture and (b) neurophysiological function, with additional contributions from chromatin regulation and genome stability. This is broadly consistent with vertebrate examples where selection shapes hybrid-genome ancestry and produces deserts of introgression.

Caveats (important for interpretation).

Your annotations are similarity-based to other reptiles; orthology is likely but not guaranteed for every locus (especially fragments/duplicates).
